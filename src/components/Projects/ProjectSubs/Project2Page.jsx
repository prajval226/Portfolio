        <strong>Seasonal Demand: </strong> Bookings peaked in January and August, while February marked the lowest point in demand. This suggests clear seasonal trends that can inform future marketing campaigns and driver incentives.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>High Cancellation Rate: </strong>A substantial 18% of bookings were canceled by drivers, and an additional 7% were canceled by customers. Investigating the root causes for these cancellations is crucial for improving service reliability.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Driver Supply Gap:</strong> Over 10,000 rides were left unfulfilled due to a "No Driver Found" status. This is a critical operational issue that points to a shortage of available drivers, particularly during high-demand periods.

      <strong>Core Vehicles Drive the Business:</strong> "Auto," "Go Mini," and "Go Sedan" are the top performers, generating the highest volume in bookings, revenue, and distance traveled.

      <br />
      <strong>Consistent Trip Lengths:</strong> The average ride distance remains uniform across all vehicle types at roughly 24.6 km, suggesting consistent customer travel habits.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Bookings = Revenue:</strong> There is a strong direct correlation between the number of bookings and the revenue generated, affirming the importance of high-volume vehicle types.

      <strong>Investigate Premium Market:</strong> Investigate the demand for premium services like "Uber XL" to assess their growth potential and market viability.

      <strong>Monthly Revenue Fluctuations:</strong> Revenue peaked in March and was at its lowest in February, with a generally stable trend throughout the rest of the year.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Peak Hours Drive Bookings:</strong> The majority of bookings occur between 6 PM and midnight, indicating that evening hours are the most critical period for the business.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Digital Payments Dominate:</strong> UPI is the most preferred payment method, accounting for almost half of all successful booking revenue. This highlights a strong reliance on digital transactions over traditional cash payments.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Optimize for Peak Hours:</strong> Focus on ensuring high driver availability during the evening peak to capture maximum demand and revenue.

      <strong>Cancellations Mirror Demand:</strong> The monthly cancellation trend is highest in January and lowest in February, directly reflecting the overall booking and revenue trends. This indicates that high-demand periods are also high-cancellation periods.

      <br />
      <strong>Improve App and Address Accuracy:</strong> Reduce customer-initiated cancellations by improving the app's address-pinning functionality and ensuring a seamless user interface.
